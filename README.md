🧩 C++ Modules — 42 School (CPP Modules)

This repository contains the projects and exercises completed during the C++ modules of the 42 curriculum.
Each module (CPP00 → CPP08) introduces new C++ concepts — from object-oriented programming to templates and exceptions.

📂 Module Structure

CPP00 — Introduction to C++: namespaces, classes, objects, basic I/O, std::string
CPP01 — Dynamic allocation, pointers, references, memory management, and file logging
CPP02 — Canonical class form, operator overloading, fixed-point numbers
CPP03 — Inheritance, copy constructors, default constructors, and destructors
CPP04 — Polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and dynamic object handling
CPP05 — Exception handling, class hierarchies, and try/catch flow
CPP06 — Type casting in C++: static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast
CPP07 — Function and class templates, generic programming, and code reuse
CPP08 — STL (Standard Template Library), iterators, containers, and basic algorithms
